# KOM Hunter

A web application that integrates with Strava to visualize and analyze your cycling activities. Built with React and Flask, this application allows you to view your activities on an interactive map, analyze heart rate data, and filter through your Strava history.

![Demo](docs/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **Strava Integration**: Connect seamlessly with your Strava account to access your activities
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize your activities on a Mapbox-powered map with customizable styles
- **Activity Filtering**: Filter activities by type (Ride, Run, Virtual Ride, etc.)
- **Heart Rate Analysis**: View heart rate data for selected activities
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and intuitive interface that works across different screen sizes

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - Mapbox GL JS
  - Chart.js for data visualization
  - Axios for API requests

- **Backend**:
  - Flask
  - Azure Blob Storage for data persistence
  - Strava API integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.x
- Azure Storage account
- Strava API credentials
- Mapbox API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lguertle/Strava_project.git
   cd Strava_project

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Create a .env file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   CLIENT_ID=your_strava_client_id
   CLIENT_SECRET=your_strava_client_secret
   REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/oauth/callback
   CONNECTION_STRING=your_azure_storage_connection_string
   REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   python blob_storage.py

2. Start the React frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. **Connect Your Strava Account**
   - Click "Connect to Strava" to authorize the application
   - Grant necessary permissions to access your activity data

2. **View Your Activities**
   - Activities are automatically fetched and displayed in the sidebar
   - Filter activities by type (Ride, Run, etc.)

3. **Explore Activities on the Map**
   - Select any activity from the sidebar to view its route
   - The map will automatically zoom to fit the selected route

4. **Map Controls**
   - üó∫Ô∏è **View Options**
     - Toggle between classic and satellite map styles using the "Map Style" menu
   - üîç **Navigation**
     - Use the search bar to find specific locations
     - Click the locate icon to find your current position
   - üìä **Data Visualization**
     - View heart rate data charts for selected activities
     - Track elevation profiles along your routes

5. **Data Analysis**
   - Analyze heart rate zones for each activity
   - View detailed statistics including distance, time, and elevation gain

## Cache Status Indicators

The segment analysis page now includes visual indicators to show whether segment efforts data will be served from the cache or require an API call to fetch. This helps users understand when actions might count against their Strava API rate limits.

### Cache Indicators

- **Green Check Badge** - Data is cached and will not require an API call
- **Yellow Lightning Badge** - Data is not cached and will require an API call to Strava's API

### Benefits

- **Avoid Rate Limits**: Helps prevent hitting Strava API rate limits by making it clear which segments have cached data
- **Better Performance**: Cached data loads faster and doesn't require API calls
- **Transparency**: Provides visibility into data freshness and API usage

### How Caching Works

- **Segment Efforts**: Cached for each segment after the first fetch
- **Force Refresh**: You can always force a refresh of data by using the refresh options menu

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- **src/**: Contains the React frontend code
  - **components/**: React components organized by feature
  - **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers
  - **styles/**: CSS and styling files
  
- **server/**: Backend server code
  - **routes/**: API endpoint handlers
  - **services/**: Business logic and data processing

- **public/**: Static assets and HTML template
- **docs/**: Documentation and resources

## Development

### Testing & Utility Files

This repository includes several testing and utility scripts that are excluded from Git tracking via `.gitignore`. These files are primarily used for local development, testing webhook integrations, and Strava API interactions:

- Webhook testing utilities
- API token management scripts
- Local server configurations
- Test data generators

If you need to use these utilities, they can be obtained separately or created following the patterns described in the documentation.

### Preparing for GitHub

Before pushing changes to GitHub, you can run the included script to verify which files will be included/excluded:

```bash
./prepare-for-github.ps1
```

This will show you which files are ignored by Git and which ones will be included in your next commit.
